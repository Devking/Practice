# Web Development Practice

In an effort to practice modern tools for web development (off the top of my head, I can think of a variety of things including Backbone, SASS, React, Grunt, Bootstrap, etc.), I've decided to start up a small repository as a workspace to familiarize the process of getting everything up and running from scratch.  

This is mainly motivated by the fact that at work, I've been using all of these cool things to help develop even cooler front-end software, but that's because everything has already been set-up for me to just jump in and use. I realize it's pretty important to really understand it all from the ground up myself, and start tinkering with it more as well.  

At first, I expect this repo to grow very slowly, and have really dummy things going on. For instance, I'll probably have the Bootstrap folder lying around in here, or I'll just have stray CSS code that's written that I really shouldn't need (or should rely on SASS for). In any case, the whole project will be an attempt on my part to pick up more tools and clean everything up and start working from there. It's probably very valuable to practice these skills, even if I don't plan on being a front-end developer in my future...
